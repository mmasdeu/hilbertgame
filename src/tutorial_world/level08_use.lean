/- Tactic : use

## Summary
The tactic use specializes the goal with a particular case.
For example, if we want to prove the statement "there exists a natural number which is odd",
we will need to provide a concrete number like 3.

/-
Sometimes we will need to prove that there exists an object satisfying certain properties.
The goal will then look like ⊢ ∃ x, P x. In this case, the `use` tactic is useful. If we know
that an object `a` satisfies the  property `P`, then `use a` will transform the goal into ⊢ P a.
